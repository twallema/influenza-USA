# Notes on results otained by fitting mobility models to the state-level data

## 2011-2015 commuter survey

- Radiation model: Poor performance.

- Departure-diffusion radiation model: Good performance.

- Departure-diffusion powerlaw gravitation model: Mediocre performance. 

## 2016-2020 commuter survey

- Results and conclusion idem 2011-2015 data.

- Mobility is higher in 2016-2020 than in 2011-2015.

## SaveGraph data

- Radiation model: Mediocre performance.

- Departure-diffusion radiation model: Poor performance.

- Departure-diffusion powerlaw gravitation model: Great performance.

## Conclusion

The commuter surveys modeled with a departure-diffusion radiation model can be used at US state-to-state level. The SaveGraph data modeled with a departure-diffusion powerlaw gravitation model can be used at US state-to-state level.
